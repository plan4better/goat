# goatlib

Shared Python library for the GOAT platform. It contains the analytics tools,
analysis algorithms, geospatial I/O, and shared models used by the `core`,
`geoapi`, `processes`, and `catalog` services.

## Package layout

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `tools/` | Analytics tools (buffer, clip, catchment areas, heatmaps, …). Each tool is a `BaseToolRunner[TParams]` subclass, registered in `tools/registry.py` and executed as a Windmill job. |
| `analysis/` | Analysis algorithms backing the tools |
| `io/` | Dataset import/export, format conversion, and remote sources (WFS, …) |
| `models/` | Pydantic models shared across services |
| `services/`, `storage/`, `tasks/` | Service clients, object storage, background task helpers |
| `computed_columns/`, `i18n/`, `config/`, `utils/` | Supporting modules |

## Adding an analytics tool

1. Create the tool in `src/goatlib/tools/your_tool.py`:
   - inherit from `BaseToolRunner[YourToolParams]`
   - define the input parameters as a Pydantic model extending `ToolInputBase`
   - implement `process()` and set `tool_class`, `output_geometry_type`,
     `default_output_name`
2. Register it in `tools/registry.py`
3. Sync it to Windmill with `tools/sync_windmill.py`

## Development

The repo is a uv workspace — sync everything from the repo root:

```bash
uv sync --all-packages
```

Run the tests from this directory:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit         # unit tests (run in CI, advisory)
uv run pytest tests/integration  # needs local infra (DB, MinIO, …)
```

## GDAL dependency

`goatlib` depends on the `gdal` Python bindings, which are distributed as an
sdist and compile against the system GDAL library — `libgdal-dev` (apt) or
equivalent must be installed to build them. Only the WFS and converter paths
in `io/` import `osgeo`, and they do so lazily, so the other services install
the workspace with `--no-install-package gdal` in CI and skip the system
dependency entirely.
